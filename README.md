# Music Library Management System

# Project Overview

* A **Music Library Management System** built with SQL.
* Implements database creation (DDL), data population (DML), and advanced queries for retrieving meaningful insights.
* Designed to handle users, artists, albums, songs, and playlists in a structured way.
* Demonstrates core SQL concepts including joins, indexing, and transaction control.

# Code

* `ddl-commands.sql` → Creates the database and tables (users, artists, albums, songs, playlists).
* `dml-commands.sql` → Inserts sample data (users, artists, albums, songs, playlists) and demonstrates updates, deletes, indexing, and transactions.
* `advanced-queries.sql` → Contains queries for retrieving insights, e.g., songs by genre and artist.

# How to Use

1. Open your SQL environment (MySQL, MariaDB, etc.).
2. Run `ddl-commands.sql` to create the database schema.
3. Run `dml-commands.sql` to insert sample records.
4. Run `advanced-queries.sql` to execute advanced queries and retrieve insights.

# Results

* Fully functional **music library database** with test data.
* Supports user management, playlists, and song organization.
* Query examples include retrieving all songs in the **Hip-Hop/Rap** genre with their respective artists.

# Future Work

* Add more genres, albums, and users for richer data.
* Implement stored procedures and triggers for automation.
* Build a front-end interface to interact with the database.
